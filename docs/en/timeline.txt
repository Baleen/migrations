Timeline
========

A ``Timeline`` is an object comprised of a :term:`version collection` that's ordered by *version*.

Public Methods
--------------

The Timeline is in charge of executing one or more migrations in any of four different ways:

.. glossary::
    ``upTowards(target)``
        Executes all migrations in **ascending sequential order**, starting from the first "pending"
        version, up to *and including* the "target" version - and skipping any versions that have already been migrated.
        Calls each migration's ``up()`` method upon execution.

    ``downTowards(target)``
        Executes all migrations in **descending sequential order**, starting from the last
        migration and down until *and including* the "target" version. Calls each migration's ``down()`` method upon
        execution.

    ``goTowards(target)``
        Combines the previous two operations into one. Executes all migrations ``up()`` to and
        including the "target" version. And then executes all remaining versions ``down()``, starting from the last
        available version and ending in the version immediately **after** the "target" version. Useful to make sure
        all versions before and including "target" are **migrated**, while all others are **pending**.

    ``runSingle(version, options)``
        Runs a single version's migration using the specified options. Can be called directly and useful mostly for
        testing purposes in a controlled environment.

Constructor
-----------

When being instantiated the Timeline requires a :term:`version collection` and a *comparator* as arguments.

.. glossary::

    ``VersionCollection $versions``
        The :term:`version collection` must contain at least one :term:`Version`. All versions in the collection must
        have a :term:`migration` assigned to them or otherwise an exception will be thrown.

        Something to note is that the ``VersionCollection`` object will be cloned before being stored in the Timeline.
        Since the Timeline doesn't have any public methods available to access the internal version collection this
        effectively means that once the Timeline is created its collection cannot be altered.

    ``callable $comparator``
        The comparator must be a ``callable`` that receives two :term:`Versions <version>` as arguments and returns a
        number less than, equal to, or greater than zero (0) if the first version should be executed before than, is
        the same as, or should be executed after the second version (respectively).

        The default comparator simply
        extracts the first number from each version and subtracts the second one from the first one. See class
        ``Version\Comparator\DefaultComparator`` for the source code.

Events
------

The Timeline is coupled with a ``TimelineEmitter`` class that fires domain events for each operation if an
``EventDispatcher`` is present. Events that will be fired are:

.. glossary::

    Before Collection
    ``EventInterface::COLLECTION_BEFORE``
        Fired before the Timeline executes one of the *collection methods* (upTowards, downTowards, goTowards). The
        listener callback will receive a `CollectionEvent` object as a parameter, which includes information about the
        collection of versions, the `Options` and the *target* version.

    After Collection
    ``EventInterface::COLLECTION_AFTER``
        Same as above, but fired once the the collection method has finished executing all scheduled migrations.

    Before Migration
    ``EventInterface::MIGRATION_BEFORE``
        Fired before the Timeline executes a single migration, which occurs both as part of executing ``runSingle`` and
        also for each of the migrations executed by any *collection method*.

    After Migration
    ``EventInterface::MIGRATION_AFTER``
        Same as above, but fired once the migration has finished.
