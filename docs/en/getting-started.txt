Getting Started
===============

Before you get started its important you understand what this particular library is about. Make sure you read the
introduction in the :doc:`index` and the following architecture overview.

Overview
--------

The Baleen projects aims to make migrations easier for anyone. All projects under the "Baleen umbrella" are meant to
be related to migrations in one way or another.

Baleen Migrations is the core of the Baleen project. It provides a domain model on top of which other migration
libraries can run their migrations.

In other words: Baleen Migrations alone is NOT supposed to be an end-user solution. Its meant to be used by other
repositories such as Doctrine Migrations, and it is those repositories that would become the end-user libraries that
framework users consume.

So if you came to this repository to find a new migrations solution then you're not quite in the right place yet.
Instead, please refer to :doc:`implementations` libraries - we hope there you'll find what you're looking for.

Installation
------------

Installing Baleen Migrations with Composer is very easy:

.. code-block:: shell

    composer install baleen/migrations

Then make sure you require the Composer autoloader:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

    // do Baleen stuff here.

You're all set!

Refer to the :doc:`examples` to see Baleen Migrations in action.
