Baleen Migrations
=================

Baleen Migrations is a project that seeks to abstract the domain logic of performing migrations of any kind into a
single package. Its simple goal is to excel at one single task: provide an intuitive, well-tested framework to migrate
from point A to point B (or vice-versa if going down).

In other words, we take care of WHICH migrations are run and in what ORDER. Everything else is left up to the
implementation:

* WHAT is going to be migrated? It could be a database, images, documents, etc.
* HOW its going to be migrated? You can wrap each migration into DB transactions. Or not, its up to you.
* What to do when a migration fails? We'll let you know WHEN it happens, but its up to you to decide what to do
  (e.g. cancel the transaction).
