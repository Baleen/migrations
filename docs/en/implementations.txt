Implementations
===============

Since Baleen Migrations is just taking its first steps there are still no major end-user libraries / implementations
that are already using it. You could be the first one to build one!

In alphabetical order:

    * `Baleen CLI <https://github.com/baleen/cli>`_: command line (CLI) wrapper to execute simple migrations. Still
      in active development.
