Implementations
===============

Since Baleen Migrations is just taking its first steps there are still no major end-user libraries / implementations
that are already using it. You could be the first one to build one!

    * `Baleen CLI <https://github.com/baleen/cli>`_: command line (CLI) wrapper
      to execute simple migrations. Still in active development.
    * `Pimcore Migrations <https://github.com/Cube-Solutions/pimcore-migrations>`_:
      a migrations library for Pimcore 3.x.
    * `Doctrine Migrations (pre-alpha) <https://github.com/gabrielsomoza/migrations/tree/baleen>`_:
      a soon-to-be PR for Doctrine Migrations. Still in progress :)
